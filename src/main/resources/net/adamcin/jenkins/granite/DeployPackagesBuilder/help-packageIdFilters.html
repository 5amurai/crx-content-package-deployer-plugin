<div>
    Specify a list of package ID filters to match against identified Vault packages located in
    the workspace. Each filter string must occupy its own line.

    A Package ID consists of the group, the name, and the version of a package, separated by
    colons (':').

    Package ID filters must follow one of three patterns:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>group:name:version</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>group:name</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>name</tt>
        </li>
    </ul>

    Each segment in the filter may be either ommitted or replaced with an asterisk ('*') to
    represent a wildcard.

    Matching packages will be uploaded in the order in which the filters are specified. Only the
    highest matching version of a package identified by 'group:name' will be deployed, and it will
    only be deployed once per build step, regardless of the number of matching filters.
